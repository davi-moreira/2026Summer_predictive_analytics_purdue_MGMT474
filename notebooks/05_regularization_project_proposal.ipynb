The CTO raises a red flag: *\"Are we memorizing noise in the training data, or learning real patterns that generalize?\"*\n\nThis is overfitting, the most common pitfall in predictive analytics. Regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net) add a penalty that forces the model to keep only the features that truly matter.\n\n> **Today's focus:** Applying regularization to prevent overfitting in our housing price model, and using Lasso's feature selection property to identify the most important predictors.\n\n---",

    "The grouped bar chart displays three bars per feature: blue for **Linear (OLS)**, orange for **Ridge**, and green for **Lasso**. For most features, the Ridge bars are slightly shorter than the OLS bars (uniform shrinkage), while Lasso bars may be noticeably shorter or completely absent for weak predictors. The printed tips below the chart summarize the pattern: Ridge shrinks *all* coefficients, Lasso can *zero out* some entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** This visualization makes the abstract math of L1 vs. L2 penalties tangible. Stakeholders who cannot parse equations can immediately see that regularization \"calms down\" large coefficients and that Lasso is more aggressive about discarding features. Use charts like this when presenting model choices to non-technical audiences.\n",
