Unlike random forests (which build trees independently), gradient boosting builds them sequentially: each new tree focuses specifically on the cases the previous trees got wrong.\n\nThis \"learn from your mistakes\" strategy often produces the most accurate models in practice. Companies like Google, Netflix, and major healthcare systems rely on gradient boosting for their most demanding prediction tasks.\n\n> **Today's focus:** Understanding the boosting paradigm, building GradientBoosting and HistGradientBoosting classifiers, and comparing them against random forests on the breast cancer dataset.\n\n---",

    "The `RandomizedSearchCV` output reports the best parameter combination found across 20 random trials. Typical best parameters on the breast cancer dataset: `learning_rate` around **0.05-0.15**, `max_depth` around **3-5**, `n_estimators` around **150-250**, and `subsample` around **0.8-1.0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **best CV score** should be equal to or slightly above the default GBM's CV score (around **0.99**). The **test score** printed below it should be consistent with the CV estimate. If the test score is much higher than the CV score, that is likely just variance on the small test set, not a real advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the `subsample` parameter: values below 1.0 mean that each tree is trained on a random subset of the training data (stochastic gradient boosting). This adds a bagging-like regularization effect that can reduce overfitting, especially when the learning rate is higher.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike Random Forests, which are relatively resistant to overfitting because they average independent trees, gradient boosting can overfit severely if you train too many iterations. Each new tree is specifically designed to correct the current model's errors, so eventually the model starts fitting noise rather than signal.\n",

Where the validation curve peaks is the optimal number of trees; continuing beyond that point hurts generalization. In production, this pattern motivates **early stopping**: halt training when validation performance stops improving."
