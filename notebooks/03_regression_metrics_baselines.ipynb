Ideally you want a formless cloud centered on the red zero-line; any visible pattern (funnel, curve, clustering) signals a problem. **Bottom row**: histograms of residuals for train and validation. A roughly bell-shaped distribution centered near zero is good; heavy right tails suggest the model under-predicts expensive properties. The printed statistics confirm that the mean residual is near zero (by construction for OLS) and report the standard deviation, which should approximately match the RMSE from earlier.\n",
