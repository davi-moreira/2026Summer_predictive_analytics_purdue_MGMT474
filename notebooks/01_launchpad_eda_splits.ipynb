   "source": "### 3.4 Using Google Gemini Responsibly: The \"Ask → Verify → Document\" Pattern\n\n**Google Gemini in Colab** is an AI coding assistant integrated directly into your notebooks. It can help you write code, debug errors, and understand concepts. However, **you are responsible for all code you submit**.\n\n**The Three-Step Pattern:**\n\n**1. ASK Gemini to draft code or explain concepts**\n\nExample prompts:\n- \"Create a histogram of the MedHouseVal variable\"\n- \"Explain what this error message means: KeyError: 'MedHouseVal'\"\n- \"Write code to calculate the correlation between MedInc and MedHouseVal\"\n- \"Generate a scatter plot showing the relationship between Latitude and house values\"\n\n**2. VERIFY the code works and you understand it**\n- Run the generated code in a cell\n- Check the output matches what you expected\n- Read through the code line by line\n- Ask yourself: \"Could I explain what each line does?\"\n\n**3. DOCUMENT with your own comments**\n- Add `#` comments explaining the logic in your own words\n- Annotate any parts that were unclear\n- Note any modifications you made\n\n**✓ What's allowed:**\n- Using Gemini to generate boilerplate code (imports, data loading, standard plots)\n- Asking Gemini to explain error messages or debugging\n- Getting suggestions for visualizations or analyses\n- Learning new pandas/numpy/sklearn functions\n\n**⚠️ What's required:**\n- You must understand **every line** of code you submit\n- You must verify that generated code works correctly on your data\n- You must add your own comments and documentation\n- You must be able to explain your code and methodology\n\n**❌ Accountability:**\n- You are responsible for all code you submit, even if Gemini generated it\n- If you can't explain your code in the project presentation, you don't understand it well enough\n- Gemini can make mistakes - you need to catch them\n\n**Example of proper use with California Housing data:**\n\n```python\n# PROMPT TO GEMINI: \"Calculate the mean MedHouseVal for coastal vs inland areas\"\n\n# Original Gemini output (verified and commented by me):\n# Create a binary coastal indicator (Latitude > 37 and Longitude < -120)\ndf['IsCoastal'] = ((df['Latitude'] > 37) & (df['Longitude'] < -120)).astype(int)\n\n# Group by coastal status and calculate mean house value\nmean_price_by_location = df.groupby('IsCoastal')['MedHouseVal'].mean()\n\n# Add my own descriptive print statement\nprint(\"Average median house value by location:\")\nprint(f\"  Inland (0): ${mean_price_by_location[0]:.2f}00,000\")\nprint(f\"  Coastal (1): ${mean_price_by_location[1]:.2f}00,000\")\n\n# My interpretation: Coastal areas have significantly higher median house values,\n# which makes sense given proximity to ocean and desirable California locations.\n```\n\n**Why this matters:** AI tools like Gemini are powerful accelerators, but they don't replace understanding. In business, you need to explain your analyses to stakeholders, defend your methodology, and catch errors. Blindly trusting AI outputs is risky.\n\n---"

Motivation Examples\n\n**Predictive analytics** is the practice of extracting patterns from historical data to make predictions about future or unknown outcomes. It's used everywhere in modern business and society:\n\n**Example 1: Email Spam Detection**\n- **Business problem:** Users receive hundreds of unwanted emails daily, wasting time and risking security\n- **Predictive task:** Classify incoming emails as \"spam\" or \"ham\" (legitimate)\n- **How it works:** Train a model on historical emails labeled as spam/ham; model learns patterns (keywords, sender characteristics, formatting) and predicts labels for new emails\n- **Business impact:** Gmail blocks 99.9% of spam, saving billions of user hours annually\n\n**Example 2: Handwritten Digit Recognition (Zip Codes)**\n- **Business problem:** US Postal Service processes millions of handwritten envelopes daily; manual sorting is slow and expensive\n- **Predictive task:** Read handwritten zip codes from envelope images (0-9 classification)\n- **How it works:** Convolutional neural networks trained on thousands of handwritten digit examples\n- **Business impact:** Automated mail sorting reduced delivery time and costs by 40%\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davi-moreira/2026Summer_predictive_analytics_purdue_MGMT474/main/lecture_slides/01_introduction/figs/zip_code.png\" width=\"400\">\n\n*Figure: Handwritten zip code recognition example from USPS automated sorting system.*\n\n**Example 3: Netflix Prize (Movie Recommendations)**\n- **Business problem:** Netflix wants to recommend movies users will enjoy to increase engagement and retention\n- **Predictive task:** Predict how a user would rate a movie they haven't watched yet\n- **How it works:** Collaborative filtering using millions of past user ratings\n- **Business impact:** $1M prize competition (2006-2009) improved recommendation accuracy by 10%, resulting in billions in retained subscriptions\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davi-moreira/2026Summer_predictive_analytics_purdue_MGMT474/main/lecture_slides/01_introduction/figs/netflix_prize.png\" width=\"600\">\n\n*Figure: Netflix Prize leaderboard showing the competition that advanced recommendation systems.*\n\n**Common thread:** All three examples follow the same workflow:\n1. Collect historical data with known outcomes\n2. Extract relevant features\n3. Train a predictive model\n4. Deploy the model to make predictions on new data\n5. Measure business impact\n\n**This course:** You'll learn the entire workflow, from raw data to deployed model, with emphasis on doing it **correctly** (avoiding leakage, overfitting) and **responsibly** (fairness, transparency).\n\n---"

Let's preview the journey using a **customer churn prediction** example.\n\n**Business Problem:** A bank notices customers are closing accounts. They want to predict which customers will churn next quarter so they can proactively offer retention incentives (fee waivers, better rates, personalized service).\n\n**Target Variable (Y):** `Exited` (binary: 0 = stayed, 1 = closed account)  \n**Features (X):** Customer demographics (age, gender, geography), account info (balance, # products, credit score), and behavior (tenure, active member status)\n\n---\n\n**Step 0: Setup and Configuration**\n- Import libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)\n- Set random seed for reproducibility (`RANDOM_SEED = 474`)\n- Configure display settings\n\n**Step 1: Data Loading and Sanity Checks**\n- Load train and test CSVs\n- Validate data types and shapes\n- Identify and exclude non-feature columns (IDs, names)\n- Check target variable is binary and present in train, absent in test\n\n**Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n- Examine target distribution (class balance)\n- Analyze univariate distributions (histograms, boxplots)\n- Explore bivariate relationships (features vs. target)\n- Compute correlations and mutual information\n- **Business insight:** Older customers, inactive members, and those with 3-4 products have higher churn rates\n\n**Step 3: Data Preparation and Feature Engineering**\n- Handle missing values (imputation)\n- Encode categorical variables (one-hot encoding)\n- Scale numeric features (standardization)\n- Create new features if needed (interactions, ratios)\n- Build preprocessing pipeline to ensure reproducibility\n\n**Step 4: Baseline Model**\n- Train simple logistic regression (interpretable, fast)\n- Evaluate with cross-validation (ROC AUC, accuracy)\n- Establish performance benchmark\n- **Baseline AUC:** ~0.75\n\n**Step 5: Advanced Models**\n- Try more complex algorithms (LASSO, tree-based methods, ensembles)\n- Tune hyperparameters\n- Compare performance vs. baseline\n- **Best model AUC:** ~0.82 (LASSO with feature selection)\n\n**Step 6: Model Comparison and Visualization**\n- Plot performance metrics with confidence intervals\n- Create comparison table (AUC, error rates, sparsity)\n\n**Step 7: Model Selection and Rationale**\n- Choose best model based on performance, stability, and parsimony\n- Document decision criteria transparently\n\n**Step 8: Final Training**\n- Retrain selected model on **full training data**\n- Save model artifact (`.joblib` file)\n- Record metadata (timestamp, features, hyperparameters)\n\n**Step 9: Test Set Predictions and Submission**\n- Load test data\n- Generate predictions (probabilities)\n- Export submission CSV with IDs and predictions\n- Validate format and alignment\n\n**Step 99: Reporting and Reproducibility**\n- Write `requirements.txt` for package versions\n- Document assumptions and decisions\n- Create executive summary of findings\n\n---\n\n**Key principles throughout:**\n- ✓ **Split first, preprocess second:** Avoid leakage by separating data before any transformations\n- ✓ **Use cross-validation:** Don't trust a single train/test split; average performance across multiple folds\n- ✓ **Lock the test set:** Don't peek at test data until final evaluation (one-time use only)\n- ✓ **Document everything:** Future you (and your stakeholders) need to understand your choices\n- ✓ **Reproducibility matters:** Set seeds (RANDOM_SEED = 474), version packages, save pipelines\n\n**In this notebook:** We'll practice Steps 0-2 (setup, EDA, splitting).

Hands-On Practice: California Housing Price Prediction EDA and Splitting\n\nNow that we understand the theory, let's apply it to a **real regression problem**.\n\n### 5.1 Business Case: California Housing Price Prediction\n\n**Business Context:**\n\nYou are a data analyst at a California real estate investment firm. The firm makes money by identifying undervalued properties, purchasing them, and either renting them out or reselling them at a profit. Accurate price predictions are crucial for two key decisions:\n\n1. **Investment decisions:** Which properties should the firm buy? (those priced below predicted value)\n2. **Portfolio valuation:** What is the current market value of the firm's existing properties?\n\nCurrently, the firm relies on manual appraisals that are expensive ($500-$1000 per property) and slow (2-3 weeks turnaround). Your task is to build a **predictive model** that can estimate house prices instantly based on property characteristics and location.\n\n**Your task:** Build a regression model that predicts median house values for California census block groups.\n\n**Target Variable:** `MedHouseVal` (continuous, measured in $100,000s)\n- **Range:** Typically $0.15 to $5.0 (representing $15,000 to $500,000)\n- **Interpretation:** Median house value for houses within a census block group\n\n**Available Features:**\n- **Location:** Latitude, Longitude (geographic coordinates)\n- **Demographics:** MedInc (median income in block group, in $10,000s), Population, AveOccup (average occupancy)\n- **Housing Stock:** HouseAge (median age of houses), AveRooms (average rooms per household), AveBedrms (average bedrooms per household)\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n- **Primary:** MAE (Mean Absolute Error) - average prediction error in $100,000s\n  - **Why MAE?** Directly interpretable in business terms (\"on average, we're off by $X\")\n- **Secondary:** RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) - penalizes large errors more heavily\n  - **Why RMSE?** Buying a house at 2× overpayment is worse than 2× small errors\n\n**Business Constraint:** The firm can tolerate prediction errors up to $50,000 (MAE < 0.5) for most properties, but large errors ($100,000+) on expensive properties could be financially disastrous. Model must balance overall accuracy with avoiding catastrophic mispredictions.\n\n---\n\n### 5.2 Load the Data from sklearn and Save as CSV\n\nWe'll use the California Housing dataset from sklearn, which is a classic regression benchmark. We'll demonstrate how to save and reload it as a CSV file for reproducibility."
