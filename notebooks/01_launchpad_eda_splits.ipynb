    "### 3.4 Using Google Gemini Responsibly: The \"Ask → Verify → Document\" Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**Google Gemini in Colab** is an AI coding assistant integrated directly into your notebooks. It can help you write code, debug errors, and understand concepts. However, **you are responsible for all code you submit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Three-Step Pattern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. ASK Gemini to draft code or explain concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example prompts:\n",
    "- \"Create a histogram of the Age variable colored by Exited status\"\n",
    "- \"Explain what this error message means: KeyError: 'CustomerID'\"\n",
    "- \"Write code to calculate the correlation between numeric features\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. VERIFY the code works and you understand it**\n",
    "- Run the generated code in a cell\n",
    "- Check the output matches what you expected\n",
    "- Read through the code line by line\n",
    "- Ask yourself: \"Could I explain what each line does?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. DOCUMENT with your own comments**\n",
    "- Add `#` comments explaining the logic in your own words\n",
    "- Annotate any parts that were unclear\n",
    "- Note any modifications you made\n",
    "\n",
    "**✓ What's allowed:**\n",
    "- Using Gemini to generate boilerplate code (imports, data loading, standard plots)\n",
    "- Asking Gemini to explain error messages or debugging\n",
    "- Getting suggestions for visualizations or analyses\n",
    "- Learning new pandas/numpy/sklearn functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ What's required:**\n",
    "- You must understand **every line** of code you submit\n",
    "- You must verify that generated code works correctly on your data\n",
    "- You must add your own comments and documentation\n",
    "- You must be able to explain your code and methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ Accountability:**\n",
    "- You are responsible for all code you submit, even if Gemini generated it\n",
    "- If you can't explain your code in the project presentation, you don't understand it well enough\n",
    "- Gemini can make mistakes - you need to catch them\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of proper use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# PROMPT TO GEMINI: \"Calculate the mean Age for customers who Exited vs stayed\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Original Gemini output (verified and commented by me):\n",
    "# Group by Exited status and calculate mean Age\n",
    "mean_age_by_exit = df.groupby('Exited')['Age'].mean()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add my own descriptive print statement\n",
    "print(\"Average age by exit status:\")\n",
    "print(f\"  Stayed (0): {mean_age_by_exit[0]:.1f} years\")\n",
    "print(f\"  Exited (1): {mean_age_by_exit[1]:.1f} years\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# My interpretation: Customers who exited are on average older,\n",
    "# which might indicate different banking needs or service preferences.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** AI tools like Gemini are powerful accelerators, but they don't replace understanding. In business, you need to explain your analyses to stakeholders, defend your methodology, and catch errors. Blindly trusting AI outputs is risky.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4.1 What is Predictive Analytics? Motivation Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predictive analytics** is the practice of extracting patterns from historical data to make predictions about future or unknown outcomes. It's used everywhere in modern business and society:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1: Email Spam Detection**\n",
    "- **Business problem:** Users receive hundreds of unwanted emails daily, wasting time and risking security\n",
    "- **Predictive task:** Classify incoming emails as \"spam\" or \"ham\" (legitimate)\n",
    "- **How it works:** Train a model on historical emails labeled as spam/ham; model learns patterns (keywords, sender characteristics, formatting) and predicts labels for new emails\n",
    "- **Business impact:** Gmail blocks 99.9% of spam, saving billions of user hours annually\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2: Handwritten Digit Recognition (Zip Codes)**\n",
    "- **Business problem:** US Postal Service processes millions of handwritten envelopes daily; manual sorting is slow and expensive\n",
    "- **Predictive task:** Read handwritten zip codes from envelope images (0-9 classification)\n",
    "- **How it works:** Convolutional neural networks trained on thousands of handwritten digit examples\n",
    "- **Business impact:** Automated mail sorting reduced delivery time and costs by 40%\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3: Netflix Prize (Movie Recommendations)**\n",
    "- **Business problem:** Netflix wants to recommend movies users will enjoy to increase engagement and retention\n",
    "- **Predictive task:** Predict how a user would rate a movie they haven't watched yet\n",
    "- **How it works:** Collaborative filtering using millions of past user ratings\n",
    "- **Business impact:** $1M prize competition (2006-2009) improved recommendation accuracy by 10%, resulting in billions in retained subscriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common thread:** All three examples follow the same workflow:\n",
    "1. Collect historical data with known outcomes\n",
    "2. Extract relevant features\n",
    "3. Train a predictive model\n",
    "4. Deploy the model to make predictions on new data\n",
    "5. Measure business impact\n",
    "\n",
    "**This course:** You'll learn the entire workflow, from raw data to deployed model, with emphasis on doing it **correctly** (avoiding leakage, overfitting) and **responsibly** (fairness, transparency).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Data leakage** occurs when information from outside the training dataset unintentionally \"leaks\" into the model, causing it to perform well during development but fail catastrophically in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's dangerous:**\n",
    "- Your model will show excellent performance on validation data (high AUC, low error)\n",
    "- You'll deploy the model thinking it works\n",
    "- In production, performance will collapse because the leaked information isn't available for new predictions\n",

    "- **Task:** Predict which patients admitted to the hospital have pneumonia\n",
    "- **Leaked feature:** `got_antibiotic` (whether patient received antibiotics)\n",
    "- **Problem:** Antibiotics are prescribed **after** diagnosis. The feature encodes the target directly.\n",
    "- **Result:** Model shows 99% accuracy in validation, but in production you don't know if a newly admitted patient will get antibiotics (that's what you're trying to predict!).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2 - Customer Churn:**\n",
    "- **Task:** Predict which customers will close accounts next month\n",
    "- **Leaked feature:** `num_service_calls_next_month` (how many times customer called support next month)\n",
    "- **Problem:** This data doesn't exist yet when you make the prediction.\n",
    "- **Result:** Model learns that customers with many calls next month churn, but you can't know future call volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to detect target leakage:**\n",
    "- Ask: \"Will this feature be available at prediction time?\"\n",

    "You are a data analyst at a European bank. The bank has noticed an increasing number of customers closing their accounts and moving to competitors. Customer acquisition costs are high (€500-€1000 per customer), so retaining existing customers is far more profitable than acquiring new ones.\n",
