    "The 2x2 grid compares residual behavior for the baseline linear model (left column) and the polynomial model (right column). **Top row** (residuals vs. predicted): look for patterns. A funnel shape means the model's error variance changes with the prediction level (heteroskedasticity). A curve means the model misses a nonlinear trend. **Bottom row** (residual histograms): a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution centered at zero is ideal. Heavy tails or skew indicate outliers or systematic mis-specification. The printed MAE and RMSE values quantify the improvement: the polynomial model should show lower error on both metrics.\n",

    "**Why this matters:** Residual plots reveal *what kind* of error your model makes, not just *how much*. Two models can have similar R² but very different residual patterns. A model with random residuals is trustworthy; a model with patterned residuals is hiding systematic bias that could be fixed with better features or a different model family.\n",

The columns include train R², validation R², the overfit gap, and validation MAE. The polynomial model likely wins on validation R², but its overfit gap is the largest. The \"Best validation R²\" line at the bottom names the winner. Notice the cost-benefit tradeoff: going from 8 to 44 features may yield only a few percentage points of R² improvement while substantially increasing model complexity and the risk of overfitting.\n",
