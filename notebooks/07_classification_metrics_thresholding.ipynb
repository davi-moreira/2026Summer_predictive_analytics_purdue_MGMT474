    "The output reports the **optimal threshold** that minimizes expected business cost. With a False Negative cost of **$50,000** (missed malignant case) and a False Positive cost of **$1,000** (unnecessary biopsy), the optimizer typically picks a threshold well below 0.5 -- sometimes around **0.1-0.3** -- because the penalty for missing cancer far outweighs the cost of a false alarm.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the optimal threshold you will see:\n",
    "- **Recall near 1.0:** The model catches nearly every malignant case.\n",
    "- **Precision drops:** More false positives are tolerated.\n",
    "- **Total cost minimized:** The combined dollar cost across all validation samples is as low as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The left plot shows the U-shaped cost curve -- cost is high when the threshold is too strict (many FN) and high again when it is too lenient (many FP), with a sweet spot in between. The right plot shows precision and recall as functions of threshold, illustrating the classic tradeoff: as threshold decreases, recall rises but precision falls.\n",
    "\n",
